      <h1>CLEAN-UP RATES</h1>
      <p>
        Our clean up rates are based on cubic feet, or weight, by the ton (two
        thousand pounds).
      </p>
      <p>
        We base our prices from what bigger companies charge. We know some
        companies like 1-800-crap, charge $920.00 to haul away 480 cubic feet,
        or 17.7 cubic yards of junk. That calculates to $1.91 per cubic foot, or
        $51.57 per cubic yard. Our prices are $1.00 per square foot, or $27.00
        per cubic yard.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hauling away something that is more heavy than bulky, we charge by the
        ton. Items such as scrap metal, concrete, and soil. We charge $75.00 per
        ton.

      <h1>Disking Rates</h1>
      <p>
        Disking rates are calculated by miles to the job site, equipment used,
        and cubic yards of area to be disked.
